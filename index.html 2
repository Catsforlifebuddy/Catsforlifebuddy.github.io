    <h1>All About Paris</h1>
    <h2>Who am I...</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Paris. I'm 14 going on 15 on Oct, 8, 2020. I'm a simple 9th grader trying my best at school and enjoying life. I love drawing and hope to become an successful artist later in life. I also want to become an engineer, exactly which type I'm not too sure yet. Maybe computer engineer, design engineer, or maybe even mechanical engineer. My main goal in life is the art career though. I have a younger sister who was born two years after me. Honestly we don't have the greatest relationship but we survive. I live with my mother and love her very much and am happy she's here for me.</p>
    <h2>What kind of art...</h2>
    <p>I like drawing <em>cartoons</em>. Everyday I'm slowly improving and <em>getting better with practice</em>. I love drawing so much which is why I want to make a career out of it. I want to do something that I'm happy with and not just work to get by in life. My plan and goal is to have my own cartoon and comicbook series(like the bone series). For a long time I've been working on a story and it's characters. I'd tell you about it, but I find that too much to think out since I'm still trying to collect it all together.</p>
